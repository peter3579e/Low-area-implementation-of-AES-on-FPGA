# Low-area-implementation-of-AES-on-FPGA
The goal of the project is to design a low-area AES encryption/decryption system written in both C and VHDL languages. Unlike high-throughput designs, low-area designs do not pursue higher and faster throughput, but pursue occupancy and power consumption in operating frequency.
